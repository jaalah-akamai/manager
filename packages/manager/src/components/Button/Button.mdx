# Button

### Overview

---

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

- Buttons are aligned right with primary button to the far right and secondary buttons positioned to the left.
- There can be more than one secondary button.
- Ideally there is one primary button per page. This helps provide a visual focus to the main purpose of the page.
- Button labels should support the user taking their desired action by clearly stating what will happen when clicked (ex. Create Linode, Delete Firewall).
- There is no destructive button style. We do not take an implied position on the userâ€™s knowledge or intention by using an alert color such as red for destructive actions.

### Primary

---

Bold and easily visible. Represents the primary or preferred action on the page.

### Secondary

---

The bold text is intentionally understated to pair well with a primary button, sit inside a table head or within a form.

### Outlined

---

This hybrid button style should be used with discretion. It is used when:

- A primary button is appropriate but is distracting or misleading. One example is a Delete button on an entity and we do not want to suggest deleting is the preferred action.
- A secondary button is appropriate but it could be missed because of its positioning on the page.
